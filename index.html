			<h2>I've started an education fundraiser with Mayan Families. I was introduced to their cause through the <a href="https://mayanfamilies.org/page/fundraiseformayanfamilies">Living on One Dollar</a> documentary. Their multi-dimensional approach to fighting poverty in Guatamala has helped improve the lives for thousands of Guatemalan families.</h2>
